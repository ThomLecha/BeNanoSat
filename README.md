# BeNanoSat

#This project aims at calculating the downlink budget of a given LEO satellite link, with a given ground station.
#In our case we are working with the EYE SAT satellite, with a ground station placed in TOULOUSE and with a the modulation type QPSK.
#All parameters are defined in the code as global variables.
